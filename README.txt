Description: A simple calculator designed using JavaScript.

File(s):

Additional Comment(s)/Note(s):
1) The calculator has to be switched on before it can be used.
2) The "State" helps to tell if the calculator is on or off
3) The "Reset" button clears the screen
4) When a result value has been displayed to the screen, entering a subsequent number would override the previous number displayed.
for example, assuming the result of "2 + 2" (4) is displayed to the screen,
if we enter the number "5", 4 would be cleared and 5 would be the number of the screen.
